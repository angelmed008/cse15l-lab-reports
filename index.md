## Command Analysis

1. **Using `cd` Without Arguments**
    - Command: `cd`
    - Outcome: `C:\Users\Angel Medina>`
    - Note: Changes directory to the home directory. This command can be executed from any directory without errors.

2. **Navigating to `C:` Drive**
    - Command: `cd C:`
    - Outcome: `C:\>`
    - Note: This means I navigated to the base level of my `C:` drive from `C:\Users\Angel Medina>`. No error here.

3. **Attempt to `cd` into `hosts`**
    - Command: `cd C:\Users\Angel Medina>`
    - Note: Error encountered. This is because the `cd` command is for navigating to directories. Since `hosts` is a file, not a directory, the command resulted in an error.

4. **List Contents with `ls`**
    - Command: `ls`
    - Note: Lists directory contents from `C:\Users\Angel Medina>`. It lists files and directories in the current working directory without errors.

5. **View `/etc` Contents**
    - Command: `ls /etc`
    - Note: Displays some contents of the `/etc` directory. If there were an error, it might be due to the directory not existing or lacking permission to view. 

6. **Check `/etc/hosts` Existence**
    - Command: `ls /etc/hosts`
    - Note: The command aims to verify the existence of the `/etc/hosts` file. However, an error occurred on Windows.

7. **Using `cat` Without Specifying File**
    - Command: `cat`
    - Note: On UNIX systems, without arguments, `cat` reads from standard input. However, an error was encountered as the directory couldn't be found on Windows.

8. **Attempt to Display Directory Contents with `cat`**
    - Command: `cat /etc`
    - Note: Error ("Is a directory") because `cat` is designed for files, not directories.

9. **Display `/etc/hosts` Content**
    - Command: `cat /etc/hosts`
    - Outcome: 
      ```bash
      127.0.0.1   localhost
      ```
    - Note: Displays the content of `/etc/hosts`. It's a system configuration file mapping hostnames to IP addresses.
